# Welcome

Hey there, glad to see you here! ðŸ‘‹

### What is the ACM Leadership Project?

The ACM Leadership Project is a group of services put together to help better understand the legacy of the Association for Computing Machinery at UT Dallas. It includes information about our officers, our members, our programs and more! The Leadership Project also includes several features designed to promote the internal team through celebrating acheivements, birthdays and anniversaries! 

There are **four** primary services offered by the Leadership Project

 - **[Leadership Site](https://leadership.acmutd.co)** - The main website for the ACM Leadership Project created using NextJS and TypeScript. Contains list of all officers, members and programs. 
 - **[GraphQL API](https://leadership.acmutd.co/api/graphql)** - A GraphQL API that allows for making powerful queries to the database behind the ACM Leadership Project. Available to use for all ACM Offiers. 
 - **[Birthdays & Anniversaries](https://github.com/acmutd/leadership/actions)** - Two complementary GitHub Actions that celebrate the birthdays and anniversaries of our officers by posting a message in Slack.
 - **[Accolades](https://leadership.acmutd.co)** - An internal recognition tool to help officers publicly shoutout the acheivements of their peers.
